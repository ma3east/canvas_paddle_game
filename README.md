###Getting practise using HTML5 Canvas by building a paddle game

Using this great, free tutorial, by Chris DeLeon @ [Twitter](https://twitter.com/GameDevsLikeYou), link to course:  [Code Your First Game on Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/code-your-first-game/learn/#/), to get more practise using HTML5 canvas.

Really good clear and simple instructions to follow, looking forward to finishing the basic structure then expanding it a bit more myself.

Technologies used: HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT
